# User Create And List App

This project is a user management application developed using Flutter for the frontend and ASP.NET Core for the backend API. It allows users to create, update, view, and delete user records. The Flutter app provides a welcoming screen with a background image and a "Create a User" button that leads to the main user management page. On the main page, users can see a list of existing users, edit their details, and delete them if needed. The backend API handles data validation, ensuring that inputs like name, email, phone number, and team name adhere to specific criteria. PostgreSQL is used as the database to store user information securely.
